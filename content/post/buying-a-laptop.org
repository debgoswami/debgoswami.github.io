** Why I needed a new laptop
As you may be aware, COVID happened in 2020. Suddenly both my wife and I were working from home. And our 2 year old toddler's school had just switched to home-based learning for the foreseeable future. We had overlapping meeting schedules and an incredibly creative childling who was completely agnostic to these trivialities. Needless to say - compromises were made.

Thus, I let go of my much beloved man-cave (it has a nicer [[https://secretlab.sg/collections/omega-series][Secretlab Omega]] chair, that my pregnant wife loves) and with it - my daily driver. A dual-boot Win10/Kubuntu desktop that I'd painstakingly set up just so.

We had a surface go we used for a quick remote login here and there - but I'll be honest, it's not nearly good enough for anything more than a tab here and there. Trust me I've tried (WSL on Surface Go IS possible - but highly inadvisable). Champion that my wife is - she really did try to use this. Her company has a proprietary JWS app that enabled remote login that we got going. It works - but spending more than a few minutes here and there is incredibly uncomfortable. I also suspect a bit of - /"No, you're not going to use this as excuse to buy yet another gadget"/ played a part in her thinking. Funnily enough, the MS whiteboard app and surface pencil have been great companions for our toddler's budding art skills.

So we agreed that she'd move to using the desktop full time and I'd get a laptop. After quite a bit of deliberation, I ended up buying the base 13" Macbook Pro (8th-gen i5) with a 16GB RAM upgrade.

TLDR: Covid + Work from Home = Lost Desktop to wife. Bought Macbok Pro

*** Big Fight: MacBook Pro vs MacBook Air
My choice to go with the Apple hardware came down to 3 main factors
**** Durability
  I've had Apple devices (iPhones, iPads and work Macbooks) for a few years now. They just /last/ longer. And with the exit of the much maligned butterfly keyboards in the 2020 models - joy all around!
**** Design + Polish
  As I mentioned, I've worked with all 3 major OS's on a regular basis. Hands down, the MacOS ecosystem is the easiest to fall (and stay) in love with. I say this as someone who *hates* having to switch around with differing ~Meta~ keys. Also, linux for all that I love it as an OS - I just can't seem to find a trouble free WDM (though KDE is awesome) that I won't spend forever tinkering with for an amateurish (mine) UX.


**** Performance

The compromise I made was on paper performance specs. The base 13" MacBook Pro model I went for has an 8th Gen i5.

*** Buy this if...

Workflow wise, I'll usually have a web browser, emacs and terminal on a single screen. Everything else I usually split into another workspace (this is possible in all OS's I use)

*** Don't Buy this if...
- It needed to be light. I'll be moving between sofas, balcony and once the world opens up - meeting rooms/venues
- Fanless. I've had multiple windows laptops before and invariably within a few years the fans stop working (or spinning endlessly)
- Longevity. Build quality is a huge plus. Although not budget constrained (within reason) - for environmental reasons, I'd prefer not to have to upgrade this within the next 3 years
- Performance-wise -> I generally don't do heavy code-compiles or ML training on my device. I do have a cloud account and my desktop for that sort of work. Neither do I need any video-editing or image-editing on this.
