* Why blog at all?


** Choosing my tools
*** Dynamic vs Static Blog
The first choice was whether I wanted to go down the route of a dynamic or static blogging framework.

Static sites follow a very simple model. There's a bunch of html files and a server that displays them. That's it. You change the html files (or add more), point the server to these changes and they're live. It's an easy model, and something that's perfect for a blog.

Dynamic sites are a bit more complex. If you've ever come across a wordpress or ghost website - these are dynamic. There's usually a more granular configuration mechanism, and correspondingly need more resources to host/serve.

I tried both, and have chosen the static flow in the end.
*** Buying a Domain
I chose [[www.godaddy.com][GoDaddy]] as my domain provider. It's quite a simple process
*** Setting up AWS
**** Accounts, Billing, Access
**** Security
*** Setting up Emacs

*** Useful Guides
**** Ghost
Some useful resources on using Ghost (which I tried and decided not to proceed for portability)
